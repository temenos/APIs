    Our Customer Segmentation API provides access to all of the customer segmentation provided by Transact and Temenos Analytics. This is all consolidated into a single customer record. 

    The primary purpose of this API is to allow bank users, analysts, and developers to get access to customer segmentation data for reporting, analysis and data visualization. The output can be combined with other Analytics APIs such as Customer Profitability to further enhance the analysis by providing additional segments for grouping and filtering. 

    The API output can also be used in combination with other Temenos APIs that have a customer/party ID to enhance the final dataset with customer segments. 
    
    The Customer Segmentation API endpoint is based on our Analytics Data Store (ADS) and as such is optimized for time series analysis. Users can select a particular date or all dates in order to analyse segment trends over time.  
    
    For more information on Temenos Analytics or our Analytics Data Store (ADS) please visit [temenos.com/products/data-and-analytics](https://www.temenos.com/products/data-and-analytics/).
    
    **Note**: This API is for information purposes and cannot be used with the Standard Transact Developer Sandbox
