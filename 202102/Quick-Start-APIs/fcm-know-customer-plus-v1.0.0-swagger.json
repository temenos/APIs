  title: Know Customer Plus (FCM API)
  description: |-
    KC+ is a risk-management solution that allows banks to standardize risk calculation process based on customer attributes. Risk assessments may be performed not only at the account opening process but also during the entire customer life cycle. KYC workflow builder uses configurable dynamic forms to enable tailored questions to each specific profile which are also available via API. More thorough and advanced than standard KYC (Know Your Customer) solutions it uses a comprehensive risk matrix including the status, range, and counts to calculate the risk based on customerâ€™s attributes. The system offers the ability to add search criteria filters or create, amend or delete assessments. It uses advanced and fully configurable algorithms to calculate compliance risk scores of new and existing customers based on the customer profile. In this way, the system provides greater flexibility, accuracy, and control.
