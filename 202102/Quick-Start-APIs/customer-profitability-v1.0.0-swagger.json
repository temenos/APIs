  title: Customer Profitability
  description: 'Our Customer Profitability API provides access to the calculation output of our Customer Profitability module of Temenos Analytics. This module calculates profitability using a Funds Transfer Pricing mechanism to assign a transfer rate to all products and ultimately calculate profitably at the Account, Product and Customer level.  
  This API supplies the aggregated customer level of detail and is primarily used to give bank users, analysts, and developers access to customer profitability data for reporting, analysis and data visualization.  
      
  
  The output can be combined with other Analytics APIs such as Customer Segmentation to further enhance the analysis.  
  
    
  **Note**: This API can only be used with a Temenos Analytics Sandbox
